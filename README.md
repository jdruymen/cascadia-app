# How to use expo router

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to run

Install ['Expo'], a framework based on react native, via this guide [here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

Once installed, run in powershell

```sh
npx expo start
```

If you have a android emulator installed, pressing a will open the emulator and run on that device. Otherwise, run via the expo app.
